# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a natural language search system similar to NotebookLM and DeepWiki, allowing users to search through markdown documents using conversational queries in Japanese and English. The system will understand context, provide relevant results, and enable interactive exploration of document collections through natural language interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to search through markdown documents using natural language queries, so that I can find relevant information without needing to know exact keywords or file structures.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user enters a natural language query in Japanese or English THEN the system SHALL return relevant markdown documents ranked by relevance
2. WHEN a user asks a question about document content THEN the system SHALL provide contextual answers with source citations
3. WHEN search results are displayed THEN the system SHALL show document titles, relevant excerpts, and file paths
4. WHEN no relevant results are found THEN the system SHALL provide helpful suggestions for refining the search

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to have conversational interactions with my document collection, so that I can explore topics and get deeper insights through follow-up questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a follow-up question THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation context and provide relevant responses
2. WHEN the system provides an answer THEN it SHALL include citations showing which documents the information came from
3. WHEN a user requests clarification THEN the system SHALL provide more detailed explanations with additional source material
4. WHEN conversation history exists THEN the system SHALL use previous context to improve subsequent responses

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the search system to understand document structure and relationships, so that I can get comprehensive answers that span multiple related documents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documents contain related information THEN the system SHALL identify and present connections between them
2. WHEN a query spans multiple documents THEN the system SHALL synthesize information from all relevant sources
3. WHEN document metadata is available THEN the system SHALL use it to improve search relevance and organization
4. WHEN documents are in different folders THEN the system SHALL search across the entire collection seamlessly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the search system to be performant and scalable, so that it can handle large document collections efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the document collection is indexed THEN the system SHALL complete indexing within reasonable time limits
2. WHEN a search query is submitted THEN the system SHALL return results within 3 seconds for typical queries
3. WHEN new documents are added THEN the system SHALL update the index incrementally without full reindexing
4. WHEN the system processes large documents THEN it SHALL handle them without memory issues or crashes

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to configure search preferences and filters, so that I can customize the search experience to my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sets language preferences THEN the system SHALL prioritize results in the specified language
2. WHEN a user applies date filters THEN the system SHALL only return documents within the specified time range
3. WHEN a user specifies folder filters THEN the system SHALL limit search scope to selected directories
4. WHEN search settings are configured THEN the system SHALL persist these preferences across sessions
